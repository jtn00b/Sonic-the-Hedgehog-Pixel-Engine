# Sonic the Hedgehog Pixel Engine
Hedgehog Pixel Engine is an open source Sonic the Hedgehog-based framework created with GameMaker Studio 1.4, created by jean_tha_n00b and IsraelGames.

This project consists of re-creating the basic elements of the classic 2D Sonic games in GameMaker Studio.

## Why this framework?
While there are many other frameworks out there that are much more worth using, this one was made with the purpose of learning further with 2D Sonic game design, as well as taking steps further with original game design for me, personally.

## Things to note
As said before, there are many other frameworks that I recommend using instead of this one if you're going for a fully-fledged Sonic fan game. If you want to use this, make sure you have an advanced understanding on how GameMaker and GML works.
