This project is **discontinued and cancelled.** You can expect a whole buggy mess when using this framework.

# Sonic the Hedgehog Pixel Engine
Hedgehog Pixel Engine is an open source Sonic the Hedgehog-based framework created with GameMaker Studio 1.4, created by jean_tha_n00b and IsraelGames.

This project consists of re-creating the basic elements of the classic 2D Sonic games in GameMaker Studio.

## Why this framework?
While there are many other frameworks out there that are much more worth using, this one was made with the purpose of learning further with 2D Sonic game design, as well as taking steps further with original game design for me, personally.

## Things to note
As said before, there are many other frameworks that I highly advise using instead of this one if you ever want to make a fan game. However, feel free to experiment with it.
**This framework has not been tested with the latest installment of Gamemaker studio 2.**
